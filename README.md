# Audio-event-Detection-with-CRNN-model
Here our task was to separate boundaries between music and speech and detect when such event occurs or stops for a course project.



PreProcessing.ipynb   prepares pre-processing of training data. 
CRNN_model.ipynb    contains the model and training and testing. 


Task-1 is detecting onset and offset of the events and logging them in a CSV file.
Task-2 is labelling the whole audio; if a class is present, then it's 1, else it's 0 at that class tag.

Please refer to the report for details of the work.
